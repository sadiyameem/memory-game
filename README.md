# Memory-Game

# Description
This is a simple Memory Game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The game consists of a grid of cards with hidden emojis. 
Players click on cards to reveal the emojis and try to match pairs. 
The game ends when all pairs are matched.

# Features
- Clickable cards that flip to reveal emojis.
- Shuffled cards every time the game resets
- Reset button to start a new game.
- Alerts the player when all matches are found (You win).
- Timer that counts how long it took you to play the game

# Motivation
I built this because I always wanted to make this type of game but never had the chance until now.

# Challenges/Learned
A challenge was to make the cards flip over and making it functional overall.
I learned how to use different types of css from the ones I typically use.
